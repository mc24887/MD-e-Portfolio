**Initial Post – ACM Case Study: Inadequate Security Measures**

In the ACM case study *“Inadequate Security Measures”*, a software developer knowingly deployed an application with known vulnerabilities to meet a client’s deadline. This decision, though commercially expedient, resulted in the exposure of user data and damaged the organisation’s professional credibility.

According to the **ACM Code of Ethics** (2018), Principle 2.9 obligates computing professionals to design and implement systems that are *“robustly and usably secure.”* The developer's decision to deprioritise known security flaws directly violates this responsibility. Similarly, **Principle 1.2, which aims** to *“avoid harm”*, was breached, as the consequences of the release harmed both end users and organisational stakeholders.

Comparatively, the **British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct** mandates that members act in the public interest and uphold integrity by *“respecting and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of others”* (BCS, 2021). The act of deploying insecure systems breaches both integrity and public interest duties. In UK law, this could raise compliance concerns under the **Data Protection Act 2018**, particularly around data minimisation and unauthorised access to personal data (legislation.gov.uk, 2018).

Professionally, such conduct reflects a failure in risk communication, project management, and ethical leadership. The decision also undermines trust within development teams, which is a core tenet of professional collaboration (Gotterbarn et al., 2018). In an industry where iterative testing and secure coding practices are expected, cutting corners even under pressure reflects poor judgement.

To uphold ethical and professional standards, developers must escalate risk appropriately, document known issues, and advocate for secure defaults, even if it means challenging commercial pressure. Transparency, accountability, and ethical resilience are essential to preserving the public’s trust in computing systems.
