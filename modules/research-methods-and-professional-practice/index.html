        <summary><strong>Initial Forum Post – ACM Case Study</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          Analysed the ACM case study <em>“Inadequate Security Measures”</em> where a developer deployed software 
          with known vulnerabilities to meet a deadline, breaching ACM Principles 2.9 (secure systems) and 1.2 (avoid harm).  
          Compared with BCS Code, obligations to act in the public interest and maintain integrity.  
          Highlighted potential breaches of the UK Data Protection Act 2018.  
          Reflected on the importance of risk escalation, documenting known issues, and resisting commercial pressure to compromise security.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in AI</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          Reviewed Correa et&nbsp;al. (2023) on global AI governance guidelines and Deckard (2023) on AI ethics in practice.  
          Reflected on the challenges of achieving consensus across stakeholders and proposed practitioner-focused guidance 
          for integrating AI ethics into secure software development.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Literature Review Preparation</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          Selected provisional topic: how AI ethics frameworks influence secure software engineering practices.  
          Drafted inclusion/exclusion criteria and identified databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, Scopus) for search.  
          Work is ongoing towards a structured outline for formative feedback.

      <!-- NEW: Unit 5 activities (added without removing anything) -->
      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Unit 5 – Data Collection Update</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          For my project on <em>Generative AI risks in software security and email workflows</em>, I will use a <strong>mixed-methods</strong> approach:
        </p>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Survey (quantitative):</strong> capture prevalence and perceptions of AI-assisted phishing, BEC and prompt-injection threats across IT/security practitioners. Analysis: descriptive stats (frequencies, cross-tabs) and hypothesis tests where appropriate.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-structured interviews (qualitative):</strong> security leads/engineers to explore governance decisions, mitigation strategies, and ethical concerns. Analysis: thematic coding (e.g., NVivo) to identify patterns and tensions (usability vs control strength).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Instruments will be pilot-tested; participation information and consent will reflect <em>purpose limitation</em> and <em>data minimisation</em>. 
          This design links large-scale trends (survey) to in-depth reasoning (interviews), directly answering my research questions.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Unit 5 – Wiki Activity: Questionnaire Design</strong></summary>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li>Use clear, unambiguous wording; avoid leading or double-barrelled questions; one construct per item.</li>
          <li>Ensure every item maps directly to a research objective; remove “nice-to-know” items.</li>
          <li>Balance open and closed questions to capture both measurable and exploratory insights; include a <em>Prefer not to say</em> option where appropriate.</li>
          <li>Apply skip/branch logic carefully; <strong>pilot</strong> to test comprehension, timing, and reliability before deployment.</li>
          <li>Embed ethics: transparent purpose, proportionate data fields, consent, retention/deletion plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          These principles improve validity, reduce bias, and protect autonomy, aligning with ACM/BCS professional codes.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Unit 5 – Reflective Activity 2: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          The <em>Cambridge Analytica</em> case (Confessore, 2018) showed how Facebook quizzes harvested personal and network data at scale and repurposed it for political micro-targeting. 
          This violated meaningful consent and <em>purpose limitation</em>, undermining trust in digital platforms.
        </p>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> Deception/lack of informed consent; conflicts with ACM 1.2 (avoid harm).</li>
          <li><strong>Social:</strong> Manipulation of public discourse; erosion of trust; disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Likely breaches of GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (lawful basis, transparency, minimisation, rights).</li>
          <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Contravenes BCS duties (public interest, integrity, privacy) and weakens accountability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Similar risks appear in mobile quiz apps requesting excessive permissions sold to advertisers, and health surveys reused by insurers to influence premiums. 
          For my study, I will apply <strong>transparency, proportionality, and explicit consent</strong> with defined retention/deletion schedules; any secondary use will require fresh consent.

        <summary><strong>Unit 6 – Summary Measures (Descriptive Statistics)</strong></summary>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Location & spread:</strong> Example – Diet&nbsp;A mean = 5.34kg vs Diet&nbsp;B mean = 3.71kg; Diet&nbsp;A showed lower variability (s = 2.54) and narrower IQR.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequencies:</strong> Brand analysis indicated dominance of Brand&nbsp;A; useful for later inferential testing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Descriptive statistics provided a reliable base to check assumptions (outliers, normality) and justify subsequent hypothesis tests.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small" open>
        <summary><strong>Unit 7 – Hypothesis Testing (Inferential Statistics)</strong></summary>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Paired <em>t</em>-test:</strong> Design&nbsp;1 vs Design&nbsp;2 – significant difference (e.g., t = 2.875, p = 0.018) → evidence Design&nbsp;1 performs better at 5% level.</li>
          <li><strong>Independent <em>t</em>-test:</strong> Diet&nbsp;A vs Diet&nbsp;B – significant difference (e.g., p = 0.0028) with Diet&nbsp;A more effective and more consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Normality of differences and (where relevant) equality of variances were examined before interpreting results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          <strong>Interpretation:</strong> I learned to frame clear hypotheses, interpret p-values with effect sizes, and distinguish statistical from practical significance.

        <summary><strong>Unit 8 – Data Analysis &amp; Visualisation</strong></summary>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> Histograms, boxplots and bar charts clarified distributions, outliers and IQR; scatterplots highlighted relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Charts were used to present and validate results from Units 6–7 (e.g., visualising narrower spread for Diet&nbsp;A).</li>
          <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Reflected on responsible visualisation to avoid misleading scales or selective presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Visualisation improved transparency and comprehension, supporting evidence-based conclusions for both technical and non-technical audiences.

    <div class="section"><h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p class="small">
        The early stages reinforced the link between ethical codes and practical decisions in project contexts. 
        Applying frameworks like ACM and BCS has shown how they can directly inform release decisions, risk handling, and governance.
        Unit 5 added practical depth: effective data collection depends on <em>method choice</em>, <em>instrument design</em>, and <em>ethics</em>. 
        Units 6–8 strengthened my statistical literacy: I can summarise data responsibly, test hypotheses correctly, and communicate results 
        through transparent visualisations. The next focus is a methodologically sound literature review and a viable, ethics-aware research proposal.
