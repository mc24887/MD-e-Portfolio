    <div class="section"><h2>Module Overview</h2>
      <p class="small">
        This module develops skills in research design, ethical practice, and professional reflection within the computing discipline. 
        Unit 5 introduced interviews, survey methods, and questionnaire design, highlighting the importance of choosing appropriate 
        data collection tools, designing unbiased instruments, and embedding ethical safeguards.

    <div class="section"><h2>Key Activities (to date)</h2>

      <details class="small" open>
        <summary><strong>Data Collection Update</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          For my project on <em>Generative AI risks in software security and email workflows</em>, I plan a <strong>mixed-methods approach</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Surveys (quantitative):</strong> Capture perceptions of AI-assisted phishing and prompt-injection threats from IT practitioners. Analysis: descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Semi-structured interviews (qualitative):</strong> With cybersecurity professionals to explore governance, mitigation, and ethical concerns. Analysis: thematic coding with NVivo to identify key patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          This design links large-scale trends with in-depth insights, directly answering my research question while ensuring ethical safeguards such as 
          clear information sheets, explicit consent, and data minimisation.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Wiki Activity – Questionnaire Design</strong></summary>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li>Use clear, unambiguous wording; avoid leading or double-barrelled questions.</li>
          <li>Ensure each item directly maps to a research objective.</li>
          <li>Balance open and closed questions to capture both measurable and exploratory data.</li>
          <li>Pilot-test questionnaires to detect flaws before deployment.</li>
          <li>Apply ethical principles: transparency, proportionality, and “prefer not to say” options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          These principles reduce bias, increase validity, and protect participant autonomy, aligning with ACM and BCS codes of conduct.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details class="small">
        <summary><strong>Reflective Activity 2 – Inappropriate Use of Surveys</strong></summary>
        <p class="small">
          The <em>Cambridge Analytica</em> case (Confessore, 2018) showed how Facebook quizzes harvested personal and network data, 
          repurposed for political micro-targeting. This violated consent and purpose limitation principles, undermining trust in digital platforms.
        </p>
        <ul class="compact small">
          <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> Deception and lack of informed consent conflicted with ACM Principle 1.2 (avoid harm).</li>
          <li><strong>Social:</strong> Manipulated democratic processes, eroding trust in research and platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Breached GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (transparency, minimisation, lawful basis).</li>
          <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Contravened BCS obligations to act in the public interest and maintain integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small">
          Other examples include mobile quiz apps requesting excessive permissions later sold to advertisers, and health surveys reused by insurers to influence premiums. 
          For my project, I will avoid such risks by applying <em>purpose limitation</em>, <em>proportionality</em>, and documented consent.

    <div class="section"><h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Unit 5 reinforced that effective data collection depends not only on method choice but also on design quality and ethical responsibility. 
        Poorly designed surveys risk unusable data and ethical breaches. For my investigation, surveys will provide breadth while interviews will provide depth, 
        supported by piloting, transparent consent, and robust analysis. This ensures that findings are both credible and ethically sound.
      </p>
