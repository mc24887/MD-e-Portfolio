## Secure Online Shopping System (OSS) Implementation

### Introduction

This project implements a secure online shopping system (OSS) using AES encryption to safeguard sensitive customer data. The solution focuses on protecting data both in transit and at rest, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and enhancing customer trust.

### Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd secure-oss
   ```
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python secure_oss.py
   ```

### Description of the Solution

The implemented solution uses AES encryption to protect sensitive data. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely recognised for its strength and efficiency. The provided Python class `SecureOSS` handles both encryption and decryption processes.

### Strengths
- **Robust Security**: AES encryption is resistant to various types of cryptographic attacks.
- **Efficiency**: AES performs well even with large datasets, ensuring minimal impact on system performance.
- **Compliance**: Helps in meeting stringent data protection regulations, enhancing customer trust.

### Weaknesses
- **Key Management**: Securely managing encryption keys is critical and can be challenging.
- **Performance Overhead**: While minimal, encryption and decryption processes do introduce some performance overhead.

## Testing

The solution has been tested to ensure that encryption and decryption work correctly. Below are the results from sample tests:

### Example Output
```plaintext
Encrypted Data: wKZyP0yR1kQzpFkzQwqLwZw8VZk5G6P5y5d5Z6lG9Q==
Decrypted Data: Sensitive Information
```

This output demonstrates the successful encryption and decryption of data using the implemented `SecureOSS` class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of AES encryption within an online shopping system, addressing the critical need for data security. By implementing robust encryption, we ensure that sensitive customer information is protected, enhancing both compliance and trust.
