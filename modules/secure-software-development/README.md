# Secure Copyright Management Application (SCMA)

## **Project Overview**

The Secure Copyright Management Application (SCMA) is a secure file storage and management system designed to enforce robust access control and data encryption, all while being user-friendly in a command-line interface (CLI). This application allows users to upload, retrieve, and manage files securely, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access.

## **Key Features**

✅ **Secure user authentication**: SHA-256 hashed passwords with role-based access control (RBAC).  
✅ **AES-256 encryption**: Ensures confidentiality of stored files.  
✅ **Full CRUD functionalities**: Users can create, read, update, and delete artefacts.  
✅ **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Differentiated access levels (Admin/User).  
✅ **Data integrity verification**: SHA-256 hash checks on stored artefacts.  
✅ **Database-driven file management**: SQLite-based storage solution.  
✅ **Automated security and code quality testing**: 

   - **Bandit** (static security analysis).  
   - **Pylint & Flake8** (PEP8 compliance & code quality).  
     ✅ **Comprehensive logging and timestamping**: Ensures accountability in all file transactions.  
     ✅ **Tested on Python 3.14** with **Windows 10 environment**.  

## Default User Credentials

For testing purposes, the following default users can be used:

- **Admin:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `password`
- **Test User:**
  - Username: `test_user`
  - Password: `guest`

⚠️ **Note:** It is recommended to change passwords in production environments for security purposes.

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python 3.14 installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Application**

```bash
python main.py
```

### **3️⃣ Troubleshooting & Common Issues**

1️⃣ **Ensure Python 3.14 is Installed**

```
python --version
```

Expected Output:

```
Python 3.14.0
```

2️⃣ **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended for Dependency Management)**

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3️⃣ **Fix SQLite Issues (If Required)**

```
pip install pysqlite3
```

## **Code Breakdown and Explanation**

### **1️⃣ main.py (Core Application Logic)**

The **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for managing users, authentication, and file operations. It follows **the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**:

- **Controller Functions:**
  - `register_user()`: Creates new users with **SHA-256 hashed passwords**.
  - `login_user()`: Authenticates users against the database.
  - `store_file()`: Encrypts and securely stores files.
  - `list_files()`: Lists stored artefacts along with timestamps.
  - `retrieve_file()`: Decrypts and restores a file for a user.
  - `main()`: Handles the program loop and CLI navigation.

### **2️⃣ db_manager.py (Database Management Layer - Data Access Object [DAO] Pattern)**

Handles **database transactions securely** using SQLite.

- **Functions:**
  - `_setup_tables()`: Creates `users` and `artifacts` tables.
  - `create_user()`: Adds a new user to the database.
  - `get_user()`: Retrieves stored user credentials.
  - `create_artifact()`: Inserts encrypted files and metadata.
  - `get_all_artifacts()`: Fetches stored artefacts.
  - `get_artifact_by_id()`: Retrieves a specific artefact.

### **3️⃣ encryption_manager.py (Security Layer - Singleton Pattern)**

Provides **AES-256 encryption and decryption** using the `cryptography` library.

- **Functions:**
  - `load_or_generate_key()`: Ensures consistent encryption key storage.
  - `encrypt_data()`: Encrypts file contents before storage.
  - `decrypt_data()`: Decrypts file contents for retrieval.

## **Security & Testing**

### **1️⃣ Security Testing (Bandit - Static Code Analysis)**

SCMA was tested with **Bandit** to identify common security issues.

```bash
bandit -r .
```

✅ **Results:** 

```
Files skipped (3):
.\db_manager.py (exception while scanning file)
.\encryption_manager.py (exception while scanning file)
.\main.py (exception while scanning file)
```

No security issues were detected, but files were skipped due to scanning errors. 

Debugging is recommended using `bandit --debug <file>`.

### **2️⃣ Code Quality Testing (Pylint & Flake8 - PEP8 Compliance)**

Ensures adherence to **Python best practices**:

```bash
pylint main.py db_manager.py encryption_manager.py
flake8 .
```

✅ **Final Pylint Score:** 9.47/10  
✅ **PEP8 Compliance:** Minor issues (long lines & missing docstrings).  

### **3️⃣ Data Integrity & Logging**

- Each file upload calculates an **SHA-256 checksum**, ensuring **data integrity verification**.
- **Logging is implemented** for user authentication attempts, file modifications, and errors.

## **Security Considerations & Enhancements**

- **Salting passwords** before hashing with SHA-256 (Recommended in future versions).
- **Session-based authentication** to prevent repeated login attempts.
- **Brute-force protection** by limiting failed login attempts.
- **Audit logging** for security event monitoring.
- **Key rotation policy** for AES encryption.

## **Design Justifications & Changes from Unit 3 Design**

During implementation, minor security improvements were made:

1. **Persistent encryption key storage** for better key management.
2. **RBAC refinement** to ensure role-based access control is enforced more strictly.
3. **Password authentication debugging** to handle incorrect input edge cases.
4. **Enhanced security testing** by integrating `Bandit`, `Pylint`, and `Flake8`.
