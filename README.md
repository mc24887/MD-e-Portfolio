### Unit 12: The Great Debate
- **Key Trends with Personal Perspective**

  **1. Trustworthy AI**

  - **Relevance**:
    - Trustworthy AI systems      will redefine risk detection and decision-making by enhancing robustness,      fairness, and accountability.
    - Key challenges include      poisoning attacks, model theft, and the need for ethical AI frameworks.
  - **Critical Analysis**:
    - While AI improves      efficiency, its adoption raises ethical concerns such as algorithmic bias      and accountability.
    - Organisations must      invest in explainable AI to address transparency issues.

  **2. Machine Learning for Security**

  - **Impact**:
    - Predictive analytics      enabled by machine learning will proactively mitigate risks.
    - Real-time anomaly      detection will strengthen defences against advanced cyber threats.
  - **Critical Analysis**:
    - Machine learning      models require extensive training data, which may not always be      available.
    - Thereâ€™s a risk of      over-reliance on automated systems without adequate human oversight.

  **3. DevSecOps Integration**

  - **Relevance**:
    - Combining security      with development and operations ensures vulnerabilities are addressed      early in the development lifecycle.
  - **Critical Analysis**:
    - Agile security methods      like DevSecOps reduce delays but demand a cultural shift and significant      training.
    - Balancing speed with      thorough security checks remains a challenge.

  **4. Risk Modelling Techniques**

  - **Relevance**:
    - Advanced risk      modelling methods like Monte Carlo simulations provide better insights      into risk probabilities and impacts.

  | **Risk Factor**        | **Probability (%)** | **Impact on Quality (%)** | **Impact on Supply Chain  (%)** |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | Supply Chain Delays    | 20                  | Moderate (15-25)          | High (30-35)                    |
  | Quality Control Issues | 15                  | High (25-35)              | Low (5-10)                      |
  | Cybersecurity Breaches | 10                  | Moderate (10-15)          | Moderate (15-20)                |

   

  - **Critical Analysis**:
    - Quantitative models      provide actionable insights but may oversimplify complex, interconnected      risks.
    - Effective implementation      requires cross-departmental collaboration and access to reliable data.

  **5. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**

  - **Relevance**:
    - Aligning ERM with      business goals creates value while addressing diverse risks.
  - **Critical Analysis**:
    - ERM frameworks enhance      strategic decision-making but require substantial resources for      implementation.
    - Industry-specific      risks need tailored approaches rather than generic frameworks.
