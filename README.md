## Reflective Piece
### Reflective Study
This section contains my reflective study based on Gibbs' Reflective Cycle, skill matrices, and planned certifications. It includes a critical analysis of experiences and highlights areas for improvement, such as time management and communication skills. The iterative process of applying theoretical frameworks such as STRIDE and Monte Carlo simulations improved my understanding of risk assessment.

#### Skills and Certifications Plan

## Seminars and Key Learnings
### Unit 1: Introductory Seminar
- Covered module structure and assessments.
- Discussed team project roles and collaborative working expectations.

### Unit 2: Risk Management Process
- Analysed differences between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.
- Evaluated the importance of user involvement in risk management decisions.

### Unit 3: Threat Modelling Introduction
- Explored distinctions between threats and vulnerabilities.
- Reviewed popular threat modelling techniques like STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees.

### Unit 4: Threat Modelling Exercises
- Created threat models for diverse scenarios (e.g., airports, banks) using STRIDE and DREAD.
- Integrated ATT&CK libraries and OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook.
- Example from the UK Bank Scenario:
  - **Threat Identified**: Malware attack on internal banking systems.
  - **Mitigation Tools**: Multi-factor authentication, Vectra AI for behavioural analysis, Rapid7 for vulnerability scanning.

### Unit 5: Security Standards in Industry
- Examined industry-specific standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA.
- Evaluated frameworks for assessing organisational compliance and mitigating risks.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - PCI-DSS ensures safe online transactions.
  - GDPR compliance fosters trust in handling customer data.

### Unit 6: Practical Implications of Standards
- Reviewed GDPR-related case studies, focusing on breaches and resolutions.
- Example:
  - **Issue**: Lack of encryption in customer communication.
  - **Solution**: Implemented end-to-end encryption and employee training.

### Unit 7: Quantitative Risk Modelling
- Discussed methods like Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes Theorem.
- Evaluated multi-criteria decision-making tools such as TOPSIS and AHP.
- **Analysis**:
  - Monte Carlo models provide probabilistic risk insights.
  - AHP enables prioritisation of risks based on impact.

### Unit 8: Implementing Quantitative Models
- Developed quantitative models for real-world scenarios.
- Example:
  - **Scenario**: Simulated disaster recovery scenarios for a critical IT system.
  - **Outcome**: Provided actionable insights for business continuity planning.
- **Graphical Insights**:
  - Risk probability distribution charts helped prioritise mitigations.

### Unit 9: Risk, Business Continuity, and DR
- Reviewed frameworks for Business Impact Assessments (BIA), RPO, and RTO.
- Proposed recovery solutions tailored to organisational needs.
- **Table**:
| Metric       | Example Value | Recovery Solution             |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| RPO          | 15 mins       | Real-time replication         |
| RTO          | 1 hour        | Automated failover systems    |
| Backup Cycle | Hourly        | Cloud storage with redundancy |

### Unit 10: DR Solutions Design
- Investigated cloud vendor lock-in issues and proposed multi-cloud strategies.
- Designed disaster recovery solutions for varying RPO/RTO metrics:
  1. **High Availability**: Active-active architecture with real-time failover.
  2. **Cost-Effective**: Warm standby architecture with asynchronous replication.
- **Diagram**:

### Unit 11: Future Trends in SRM
- Analysed emerging trends such as AI, DevSecOps, and automation.
- Example:
  - **Trend**: Trustworthy AI systems.
  - **Impact**: Enhanced decision-making and threat-detection capabilities.
- **Reference Analysis**:
  - AI bias mitigation was discussed using frameworks like FairML.

### Unit 12: The Great Debate
- Debated the most influential Security and Risk Management trends for the next five years, focusing on AI, machine learning, and DevSecOps. The session involved presenting arguments and supporting evidence for peer review.
- **Outcome**:
  - DevSecOps integration was voted the most impactful due to its agility and continuous security enforcement.
